# Math Expression Converter

## Overview
Math Expression Converter is a C++ program that converts mathematical expressions between different notations (infix, prefix, and postfix).
This project aims to build a solid foundation for handling mathematical expressions efficiently and serves as a good example of how to use stacks in C++.

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
The MVP focuses on providing core functionality for converting mathematical expressions while ensuring correctness and readability.

### Features of the MVP:
- **Convert infix to prefix:** Supports basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**` for exponentiation).
- **Convert infix to postfix:** Ensures correct operator precedence and handles multi-digit numbers.
- **Handles parentheses correctly:** Supports expressions with `()` for proper grouping.
- **Processes both single-digit and multi-digit numbers:** Maintains proper formatting.
- **Error-free conversion:** Ensures correct parsing and maintains mathematical correctness.

## Product Roadmap
- **Extend conversion support:**
  - Convert **prefix to postfix**
  - Convert **prefix to infix**
  - Convert **postfix to infix**
  - Convert **postfix to prefix**
- **Improve error handling:** Detect and report invalid expressions.
- **Optimize performance:** Enhance efficiency for large expressions.
